# NovoFont
Work in progress font format using vector graphics

Most of the HTML and JS here is just to visual/test,
an implementation of textfield, and textarea will be
largely based on this code.

Hylitejs will have this as a backup rendering system, because
it is much easier to just write your own selection code than
to use web standard one.

Also, I want to make fonts, and all of the font formats suck (imo),
and this will be an easy way for me to do some easy inkscape font design.

The editor code will be ported over to a few other frameworks
so that it's not just an implementation for the web.

JavaFX will likely be the second implementation because it's
got some Path2D rendering stuff to accellerate porting.

This project is very early in development.

To test it out you can clone or download the zip and extract it
then double click on novofont.html to load it into your browser

I've been using a bunch of modern features, so if you have a crap
browser, it's likely that this code will do very little :P
All of my testing has been in FireFox Dev edition version 64.0b5
